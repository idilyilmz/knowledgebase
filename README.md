# Knowledgebase

A personal knowledge base containing everything I learn: programming concepts, tools, CS fundamentals, notes from books and courses, and useful references.  
This repo is meant to grow over time and serve as my long-term learning archive.

## 🧭 How to Use
- Each topic lives in its own Markdown file.
- Keep notes atomic — one concept per file.
- Use internal links to connect related notes.
- Tags (optional) help categorize broader themes.

---

## ✍️ Conventions
- File names: `lowercase-with-dashes.md`
- Avoid giant files — split when needed.
- Include examples, diagrams, or commands when useful.
- Place language-specific notes under `/programming/<language>/`
- Place general concepts in shared folders like `/patterns/` or `/algorithms/`

## 🚧 Future Plans
- Add cheatsheets  
- Add example projects  
- Add diagrams or mind-maps  
- Clean up cross-linking

If you want, I can also help you generate:
- a `.gitignore`
- a starter folder structure with placeholder files
- a script to auto-create new notes with templates

Just tell me!
