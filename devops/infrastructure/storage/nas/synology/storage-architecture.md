# 4. Storage Architecture

How data is actually laid out

## 4.1 Storage Pools vs Volumes
### How to check what Storage you have:
1. Go to **DSM**
2. Then to **Storage Manager**
3. **Storage Pool**
4. That will tell you **RAID Type** / **SHR** / **Basic** / **JBOD**
5. That immediately tells you what your total usable storage is.

## 4.2 Thin vs thick provisioning

## 4.3 SHR vs traditional RAID

## 4.4 Multiple volumes strategy
