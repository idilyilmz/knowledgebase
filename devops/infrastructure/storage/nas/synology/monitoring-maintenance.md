### Beeping
Make sure to NEVER remove a disk while the NAS is on. When you do you will get an annoying beeping, this beeping is just telling you something is wrong and you should fix it. When this does however, you can stop the beeping with the following steps:

1. Go to **Control Panel**
2. Select Hardware & Power
3. Stay in the **General** tab
4. Find **Beep Control**

In beep control there's options to select when the beeping should occur. After that there's a **reason for current beep** make sure to *mute* that.

#### REMEMBER
The issue isn't fixed now. Just the beeping has stopped.
