## 1. Using Your Own Data
- so far, you worked with provided datasets
- now, you’ll learn to use your own datasets to create visualizations

## 2. Kaggle Datasets
- kaggle Datasets is a platform for storing your datasets and accessing **tens of thousands of public datasets**
- access it here: Kaggle Datasets (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- dataset file types include **CSV**, **JSON**, **SQLite**, **BigQuery**, etc.
- for this course, focus on **CSV files** since they are compatible with the tools you’ve been using

## 3. Searching for Datasets
- use the **search bar** to find datasets (e.g., type `"comic"` to find comic book character datasets)
- example: *FiveThirtyEight Comic Characters Dataset* contains 3 files, including CSVs you can use
- click on a dataset to view details and preview files in the **Data Explorer**
- explore **tabs like Discussion** to see community insights about the dataset

## 4. Uploading Your Own Dataset
- to use your own dataset:
    1. go to Kaggle Datasets → click **New Dataset**.
    2. upload tabular data (Excel, Google Sheets, etc.); it will be **converted to CSV** automatically
- once uploaded, you can use it just like any other dataset in your analyses
