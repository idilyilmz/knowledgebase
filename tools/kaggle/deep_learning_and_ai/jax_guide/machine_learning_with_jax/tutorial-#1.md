# Machine Learning With JAX

## Tutorial 1

### Fact 1

JAX's syntax is remarkably similar to NumPy's

### Fact 2

JAX arrays are immutable (embrace the functional programming paradigms)

JAX -> JIT --> XLA

### Fact 3

JAX handles random numbers differently (for a good reason! we'll see later why)

### Fact 4

JAX is AI accelerator agnostic. Some code runs everywhere.
