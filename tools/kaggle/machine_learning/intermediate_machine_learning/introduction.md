## 1. Introduction
- this course focises on **improving machine learning model quality** using practical, real-world techniques
- you'll learn how to:
    - handle **missing values** and **categorical variables**
    - build **pipelines** for cleaner, more reliable ML code
    - use **cross-validation** for stronger model evaluation
    - train **advanced models** like XGBoost
    - avoid common mistakes such as **data leakage**
- each lesson includes **hands-on exercises** using the Kaggle Housing Prices dataset
- progress is measured by submitting predictions to a Kaggle competition and tracking leaderboard performance
