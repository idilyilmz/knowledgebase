## 1. Introduction
- before building an AI system, it is essential to consider human needs and whether the system should be built at all
- human-centered design (HCD) focuses on designing AI systems that serve people effectively, ethically, and safely

## 2. Approach
- HCD involves people at every stage of the design process, starting as early as the idea phase
- the approach varies by context but generally follows six key steps:

### a. Step 1 - Understand people’s needs to define the problem
- work directly with diverse users to understand real problems and pain points through observation, interviews, focus groups, and feedback
- involving the entire team ensures shared understanding and helps define inclusive, well-scoped problems

### b. Step 2 - Ask if AI adds value to any potential solution
- evaluate if AI is truly necessary by asking whether:
    - the goal is broadly beneficial
    - non-AI solutions would be significantly worse
    - the task suits AI (e.g., repetitive or complex)
    - similar AI solutions have worked before
        - if not, AI may not be appropriate

### c. Step 3 - Consider the potential harms that the AI system could cause
- assess risks across the full lifecycle (data, training, deployment), including bias, privacy, and social impact
- if harms outweigh benefits, the system should not be built
- human judgment and privacy safeguards are critical

### d. Step 4 - Prototype, starting with non-AI solutions
- start with simple, non-AI prototypes to understand user expectations and interactions
- collect feedback from diverse, informed participants and iterate early to avoid costly mistakes later

### e. Step 5 - Provide ways for people to challange the system
- users should be able to question, modify, or opt out of AI decisions
- provide explanations, controls, feedback channels, and support systems to handle user concerns

### f. Step 6 - Build in safety measures
- continuously monitor performance, fairness, and unintended behavior
- use testing, human oversight, red teams, and alert systems to identify and reduce risks throughout the system’s lifecycle

## 3. Key takeaway
- human-centered design helps ensure AI systems are useful, fair, safe, and aligned with human values by prioritizing people before technology.
