# Supervised vs Unsupervised learning

## Supervised Learning

**Supervised learning** is when you train a model on labeled data - meaning each example comes with the correct answer. You're essentially teaching by example with a "supervisor" providing the right answers. The model learns to map inputs to outputs based on these examples.

Common tasks include:
- Classification (is this email spam or not spam?)
- Regression (predicting house prices based on features)
- Image recognition (identifying cats vs dogs in photos)

The key is you need labeled training data, which can be expensive and time-consuming to create.

## Unsupervised Learning

**Unsupervised learning** is when the model explores unlabeled data to find patterns on its own, without being told what the "right answer" is. There's no supervisor - the algorithm has to discover structure in the data independently.

Common tasks include:
- Clustering (grouping customers by purchasing behavior)
- Dimensionality reduction (compressing data while preserving important information)
- Anomaly detection (finding unusual patterns in network traffic)

Think of it this way: supervised learning is like studying for a test with an answer key, while unsupervised learning is like exploring a new city without a map and trying to figure out how the neighborhoods are organized.

## Semi-Supervised learning

In practice, there's also **semi-supervised learning** (using a small amount of labeled data with lots of unlabeled data) and **reinforcement learning** (learning through trial and error with rewards and penalties), which blend aspects of both approaches.
