# Module 2: Linear Algebra

## 3. Length of a vector

### Definition

The **length** (or magnitude) of a vector is calculated by finding the square root of the sum of the squares of its components. 

### Formulas
- For a 2D vector 

$$\mathbf{v} = (x, y)$$

:
  
  $$
  |\mathbf{v}| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
  $$

- For a 3D vector 

$$\mathbf{u} = (x, y, z)$$

:
  
  $$
  |\mathbf{u}| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}
  $$

This is derived from the Pythagorean theorem.

### Steps to Calculate Vector Length

1. **Square each component** of the vector.
2. **Add the squared values** together.
3. **Take the square root** of the sum to find the vector's length.

### Examples

- **2D Vector**: For 

$$\mathbf{a} = (3, 4)$$

:

  $$
  |\mathbf{a}| = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5
  $$

- **3D Vector**: For 

$$\mathbf{u} = (2, 4, -1)$$

:

$$
|\mathbf{u}| = \sqrt{2^2 + 4^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 16 + 1} = \sqrt{21}
$$

### Notation

The length (or magnitude) of a vector 

$$\mathbf{v}$$

is often denoted by 

$$ |\mathbf{v}| $$
