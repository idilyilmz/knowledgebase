# Module 2: Linear Algebra

## 2. Dot product

### Definition

The **dot product**, also known as the **scalar product**, combines two vectors to produce a single scalar value. It measures how much two vectors point in the same direction.

### Formula
The dot product of two vectors 

$$
\mathbf{a}
$$

and 

$$
\mathbf{b}
$$

is calculated as:

$$
\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = |\mathbf{a}| |\mathbf{b}| \cos(\theta)
$$

where 

$$
|\mathbf{a}|
$$ 

and 

$$
|\mathbf{b}|
$$ 

are the magnitudes (lengths) of vectors 

$$
\mathbf{a}
$$

and 

$$
\mathbf{b}
$$

, and 

$$
\theta
$$ 

is the angle between them.

If the components of the vectors are known (e.g., for 2D vectors 

$$
\mathbf{a} = (a_1, a_2)
$$ 

and 

$$
\mathbf{b} = (b_1, b_2)
$$ 

the dot product can be expressed as:

$$
\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_2
$$

### Interpretation

- **Positive Dot Product**: Vectors are generally pointing in the same direction.
- **Zero Dot Product**: Vectors are perpendicular (orthogonal) to each other.
- **Negative Dot Product**: Vectors are generally pointing in opposite directions.

### Example

For the vectors 

$$\mathbf{a} = (2, 3)$$ 

and 

$$\mathbf{b} = (-3, 5)$$

:

$$
\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = 2 \cdot (-3) + 3 \cdot 5 = 9
$$
