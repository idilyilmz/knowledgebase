### Mean

$$
X̄ = \frac{Σx}{n}
$$

- **\(Σ\)**: Summation symbol, represents the sum of all values.
- **\(n\)**: Number of values in the dataset.
- **\(X̄\)**: Represents the mean (average) of the dataset.

---

### Range

$$
\text{Range} = \text{Maximum} - \text{Minimum}
$$

- **Maximum**: The highest value in the dataset.
- **Minimum**: The lowest value in the dataset.

---

### Interquartile Range (IQR)

$$
\text{IQR} = Q3 - Q1
$$

- **\(Q3\)**: Third quartile, the median of the upper half of the data.
- **\(Q1\)**: First quartile, the median of the lower half of the data.

---

### Quartiles

- **Q2**: The median, or second quartile, which divides the dataset into two equal halves.
- **Q1**: The median of the lower half of the dataset (excluding Q2).
- **Q3**: The median of the upper half of the dataset (excluding Q2).

---

### Variance (General)

$$
σ^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - μ)^2}{N}
$$

- **\(σ^2\)**: Variance of the population.
- **\(N\)**: Total number of observations in the population.
- **\(x_i\)**: Each individual value in the dataset.
- **\(μ\)**: Mean of the population.

---

### Sample Variance

$$
s^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n - 1}
$$

- **\(s^2\)**: Sample variance.
- **\(n\)**: Total number of observations in the sample.
- **\(x_i\)**: Each individual value in the sample.
- **\(bar{x}\)**: Sample mean.

---

### Characters Meaning

- **\(Σ\)**: Summation symbol, indicates adding a sequence of numbers.
- **\(x_i\)**: Represents individual data points in a dataset.
- **\(n\)**: The number of observations in a sample.
- **\(N\)**: The total number of observations in a population.
- **\(μ\)**: The mean (average) of the population.
- **\(X̄\)**: The mean (average) of a sample.
- **\(σ\)**: The standard deviation of a population.
- **\(s\)**: The standard deviation of a sample.

These formulas and terms are essential for understanding statistical measures of central tendency and spread, enabling effective data analysis.
