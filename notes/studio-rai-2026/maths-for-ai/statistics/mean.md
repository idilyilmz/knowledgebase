## 1. Mean

In this lesson you'll learn:

- How to read mathematical notation
- How to write the mean as a formula

### Mean Lesson Summary 

The **mean** is the average calculated from interval or ratio data. To find the mean, follow these steps:

1. **Add all values** together.
2. **Divide** the sum by the **number of values**.

To simplify, mathematicians use symbols: 

- **Σ** (σ) for sum 
- **n** for the number of values 
- **X̄** (X-bar) to denote the mean

Thus, the mean can be expressed in notation as:

$$
X̄ = Σx / n
$$

This notation makes the process of calculating the mean more concise.
