## 13. Population and Sample

After this lesson you know:
- What the difference is between the sample and the population.
- What a representative sample means.
- How the characteristics about the population and sample are denoted.

### Summary of Population and Sample Concept

**Population**: The entire group of individuals that researchers wish to study. It can vary in size depending on the context, such as first-year medical students or all US citizens.

**Sample**: A smaller subset drawn from the population, used to make inferences about the larger group. It is crucial for the sample to be **representative**, reflecting the population's characteristics, such as age and education level.

#### Notation:

- **Population characteristics** are indicated by **Greek letters**:
  - **μ**: Population mean
  - **σ**: Population standard deviation
- **Sample characteristics** use **Roman letters**:
  - **x̄**: Sample mean
  - **s**: Sample standard deviation

#### Types of Statistics:
1. **Descriptive Statistics**: Occurs when the sample size equals the population size, allowing comprehensive conclusions (e.g., counting students in a class).
2. **Inferential Statistics**: Applies when the sample size is smaller than the population, requiring conclusions based on limited information.

This distinction between population and sample is fundamental in statistics.
