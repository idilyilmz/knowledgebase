## 7. Spread

In this lesson you will learn:
- What spread is
- Why spread is important

### Summary of Spread in Data

Understanding **spread** is crucial in addition to analyzing the center of data. Spread refers to how much data values differ from one another and from the measure of center. 

- **Example**: An average of **1,000** people travel by train hourly, with each wagon accommodating **100** people. If actual numbers vary significantly (e.g., doubling unexpectedly), relying solely on the average becomes inadequate for determining the number of required wagons.

- **Dotplots** can visualize spread, where each dot represents a certain number of people. Variations in dot height indicate different numbers traveling at different times. Consistent dots across hours suggest no variation; fluctuating dots indicate significant variation.

- To effectively allocate resources (like wagons), assessing spread is essential, as it helps identify peak travel times and necessary adjustments throughout the day. 

### Conclusion

Considering spread allows for a better understanding of data variability, making it vital for accurate planning and resource allocation. The more varied the data, the greater the spread, leading to more informed decision-making.
