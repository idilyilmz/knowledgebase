## 8. Measures of Speed

In this lesson you will learn:
- Why you would want to measure spread
- That there are multiple measures of spread

We assume that you know the following terms:
- Spread
- Measure of centre

### Summary on Measures of Spread

When comparing groups, evaluating the **spread** of data is as important as assessing the **center**. 

#### Key Concepts

- **Measure of Center**: The best description is **“The point around which most of the data is concentrated.”**
- **Spread**: The most fitting description is **“How much the data values differ from each other.”**

#### Visualizing Spread

When inspecting the number of travelers at Gare de Lyon with a dotplot, you can determine the spread:

- If there's **little to no spread**, it indicates consistent travel numbers.
- If there's **a lot of spread**, it suggests significant variation in traveler numbers.

#### Criteria for Adding Rush-Wagons

To decide which route should receive rush-wagons (extra capacity), the best criterion is to look for the **highest measure of center**, as it indicates the time with the most travelers, especially during peak hours.

#### Measures of Spread

Typically, measures of spread include:

- **Range**
- **Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD)**
- **Variance**
- **Standard Deviation**

Among these, **median** is **not** a measure of spread.

#### Route Selection for Rush-Wagons

Given measures of spread for different routes:

- **Route 1**: 23.2
- **Route 2**: 15.6
- **Route 3**: 24.5
- **Route 4**: 19.2

You would choose **Route 3** for its highest measure of spread (24.5).

### Conclusion

Using numerical measures of spread allows for better decision-making when comparing multiple datasets, especially in dynamic contexts like train travel. Understanding these measures helps identify the variability within the data, allowing for more informed resource allocation.
