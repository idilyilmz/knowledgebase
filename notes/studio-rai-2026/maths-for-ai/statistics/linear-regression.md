# Module 1: Statistics

Everything you need to know for statistics !

## 20. Linear Regression

This lesson will teach you:
- to think straight about linear regression.
- when to use linear regression.
- how to come up with a regression formula.

We assume you know:
- How to see if there is a relation between two variables from a scatterplot

### Summary of Linear Regression Lesson

This lesson focuses on **linear regression**, a statistical method used to predict the value of one variable based on another when there is a linear relationship.

#### Key Concepts

1. **Purpose**: Linear regression allows you to make predictions, such as estimating house prices based on their area or predicting blood pressure from age.
   
2. **Linear Relations**: Linear regression only applies to linear relationships. If data points do not form a straight line, linear regression cannot be used.

3. **Methodology**:
   - **Scatter Plot**: Visual representation helps identify relationships between variables.
   - **Formula**: The relationship is expressed as:
     \[ 
     y = b_0 + b_1 x 
     \]
     - \( b_0 \) (Intercept): Value of \( Y \) when \( X = 0 \).
     - \( b_1 \) (Slope): Change in \( Y \) for a one-unit change in \( X \).

4. **Calculation**: To predict \( Y \), you need to calculate the slope and intercept:
   - Example: If a person's blood pressure increases by 0.25 mmHg for each additional year of age, the slope is 0.25.

5. **Interpretation**:
   - The intercept \( b_0 \) can sometimes provide meaningful insights (e.g., predicted blood pressure at age 0), but may also be nonsensical in other contexts (e.g., weight of a 0 cm tall individual).

#### Conclusions

- **Application**: Use linear regression to predict values when there is a linear relationship between variables measured at the interval or ratio level.
- **Practice**: Challenges at the end of the lesson will help solidify understanding of the concepts and calculations introduced.
