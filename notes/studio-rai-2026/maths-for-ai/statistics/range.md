# Module 1: Statistics

Everything you need to know for statistics !

## 3. Range

In this lesson you will learn:
- What the variation of your data means
- A first measure to you can use to express variation: the range

### Variation Lesson Summary

**Variation** refers to the extent to which values in a dataset differ from each other. Understanding variation is crucial, as it provides insight into the distribution of data points around the center.

#### Importance of Measuring Variation

- **Visual Assessment**: Judging variation by eye can be challenging, especially with large datasets (e.g., **10,000 values**).
- A numerical measure simplifies understanding the differences among values.

#### The Range as a Measure of Variation

The **range** is the first measure of variation, defined as the difference between the highest and lowest values in a dataset.

#### Formula for the Range

$$ 
\text{Range} = \text{Maximum} - \text{Minimum} 
$$

#### Worked Example

To find the range for **Group A**:

- **Maximum value**: **38**
- **Minimum value**: **26**

Applying the formula:

$$
\text{Range} = 38 - 26 = 12 
$$

Thus, the range is **12**.

#### Summary

- **Variation** indicates how much values differ from each other.
- The first measure discussed, the **range**, is calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum values:

$$
\text{Range} = \text{Maximum} - \text{Minimum} 
$$ 

Understanding the range helps assess the spread of data effectively.
