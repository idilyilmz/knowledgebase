## 2. Median

In this lesson you will learn:
- What a measure of centre is.
- What outliers are.
- What the median is and how to find it.


### Median Lesson Summary

The **median** is a measure of center that represents the middle value of a data set, offering a more accurate depiction of central tendency in cases where outliers are present.

#### Importance of the Median

- While the **mean** provides a useful measure of central tendency, it can be distorted by outliers, such as a very high or low value that significantly affects the average.
- For instance, if a group has a mean age of **21.3 years**, but consists largely of children with one elderly participant, the mean may not accurately reflect the group’s actual demographic.

#### Steps to Calculate the Median

1. **Order** all values from low to high.
2. **Count** the total number of values.
3. **Divide** the count by **2** and round up to determine the position of the median.
4. **Locate** the middle value based on the position determined in step 3.

#### Worked Example

Given the dataset: **[4, 5, 16, 2, 4, 8, 25]**:

1. Ordered: **[2, 4, 4, 5, 8, 16, 25]**
2. Count: Total of **7 values**.
3. Position: **7 / 2 = 3.5** (round up to **4**).
4. Middle value: **5**.

Thus, the median is **5**.

#### Different Scenarios

For an even number of values, the median is the **mean** of the two middle values.

#### Summary

- The median effectively identifies the middle value in a dataset.
- It is particularly beneficial in the presence of outliers, ensuring a more representative measure of center.
- Calculating the median requires arranging the data, counting values, determining the middle position, and finding that middle value.
