# Module 1: Statistics

Everything you need to know for statistics !

## 15. Histogram

In this lesson you will learn:
- What a histogram is and how to make one

We assume you know:
- What a continuous variable is
- What a bar graph is

### Concise Summary of Histogram vs. Bar Graph

When visualizing a large dataset of people's ages, using a bar graph can be challenging because age is measured on a **ratio scale**. Bar graphs are more suitable for **nominal/ordinal** data. 

#### Solutions

1. **Grouping Ages**: 
   - Divide ages manually into categories like young (0-18), adults (18-50), and seniors (50+).
  
2. **Using Classes/Bins**: 
   - Create fixed groups (e.g., 8 bins each covering a 4-year range).

#### Histograms

When using fixed groups, the chart becomes a **histogram**:
- **Characteristics**:
  - Data is divided into uniform groups.
  - Recommended group count is typically **8-10**.
  - Bars are adjacent, indicating continuous data connection.

#### Conclusion

For interval/ratio data, a histogram is preferred, allowing for clearer representation of age distribution compared to a bar graph.
