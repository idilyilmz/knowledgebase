Everything you need to know for statistics !

## 14. Box Plot

In this lesson you will learn:
- What variance is and why it is so important
- What a boxplot is and how to read it

We assume you completed the following lesson:
- Median
- Range
- Quartiles

### Summary of Box Plot Lesson Assignment

The assignment involves advising an ambulance service on the best route for delivering donor organs within 4 hours. Two routes are considered: the **highway** and the **city center**. 

#### Key Data Points

| Route         | Mean (hours) | Median (hours) |
|---------------|--------------|----------------|
| Highway       | **2.3**      | **1.7**        |
| City Center   | **2.8**      | **2.8**        |

Based on initial data, the highway seemed to be the better choice for a quicker delivery. However, complications arose when it was found that although the highway is generally faster, it can become significantly delayed during accidents. In contrast, the city center, while usually slower, allows for alternative routes, ensuring deliveries stay under the 4-hour limit.

#### Importance of Variation

The lesson emphasizes the importance of understanding both the **measure of center** (mean and median) and the **variation** (spread of data). This is crucial because relying solely on central measures can lead to flawed decisions, as illustrated by the unfortunate incident of late organ delivery.

#### Box Plot Overview

- **Middle Bar**: Represents the **median**.
- **Box**: Encloses the **middle 50%** of the data, defined by the first quartile (Q1) and third quartile (Q3).
- **Lines**: Indicate the minimum and maximum values.

#### Conclusion

A box plot effectively visualizes both the measure of center and the variation of data. Understanding the variation allows decision-makers, such as the ambulance service manager, to make more informed choices, avoiding potential disasters in critical situations.
