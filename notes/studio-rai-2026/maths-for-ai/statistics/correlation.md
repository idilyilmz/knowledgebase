# Module 1: Statistics

## 21. Correlation (conceptual)

In this lesson you will learn
- An easy to interpret standardised measure to express the strength of the linear relationships between variables 

We assume you know:
- How to asses the strength of the relationship based on a scatterplot

### Summary of Correlation Coefficient Lesson

This lesson discusses the **correlation coefficient**, specifically **Pearson's R**, which measures the strength of the linear relationship between two numerical variables, using the example of housing prices and crime rates.

#### Key Points

1. **Definition**: The correlation coefficient quantifies the strength of a linear relationship between two variables on a scale from **-1 to 1**.
   - **1**: Perfect positive correlation
   - **-1**: Perfect negative correlation
   - **0**: No linear correlation

2. **Interpretation**:
   - A correlation of **-0.58** indicates a moderate negative relationship, suggesting that as violent crimes decrease, housing prices tend to rise.
   - Low correlation does not imply no relationship; the relationship could be **non-linear**.

3. **Causation**: Correlation does not imply causation; it simply reflects the strength of the relationship without stating that changes in one variable cause changes in another.

#### Conclusions

The lesson emphasizes understanding the correlation coefficient as a standardized tool for comparing relationships between variables, recognizing that correlation does not determine causation, and acknowledging the possibility of non-linear relationships even with a low correlation.
