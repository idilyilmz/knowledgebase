# Module 1: Statistics

## 16. Normal Distribution

In this lesson you will learn:
- What the Normal distribution is.
- Important characteristics of the Normal distribution.
- How you can use a Normal distribution to predict how likely it is to find a certain value.

We assume you have seen the following terms before:
- The measures of central tendency: mean, mode, median.
- Standard deviation.

### Summary of Normal Distribution

The **Normal distribution**, often represented as a **bell curve**, is a common distribution for continuous variables. Key characteristics include:

#### Key Features

- The peak of the curve represents the **mean**, and the height indicates the frequency of values.
- Values further from the mean occur less frequently. For example, the **IQ** scores are normally distributed with a **mean of 100** and a **standard deviation of 15**.

#### Axes Description

- **X-axis**: Represents the continuous variable.
- **Y-axis**: Represents frequency or probability of observing that value.

#### Symmetry and Values

- The distribution is **perfectly symmetric**, meaning **50%** of data is on either side of the mean.
- The **mean**, **median**, and **mode** are all located at the same point on the curve.

#### Standard Deviation

- A **small standard deviation** indicates low variation, resulting in a **narrow** curve.
- A **large standard deviation** indicates high variation, resulting in a **wider** curve.

#### Empirical Rule

The **Empirical Rule** quantifies the likelihood of observing certain scores:
- **68%** of values fall within **±1** standard deviation from the mean.
- **95%** of values fall within **±2** standard deviations from the mean.

#### Conclusion

The Normal distribution serves as a fundamental concept in statistics, characterized by its symmetry, the relationship of mean, median, and mode, and the predictive capabilities offered by the Empirical Rule.

#### Tips

- In the normal distribution, the mean, the mode and the median are equal.
- Normally distributed means that the scores of most people are relatively close to the mean, compared to the scores far removed from to the mean.
