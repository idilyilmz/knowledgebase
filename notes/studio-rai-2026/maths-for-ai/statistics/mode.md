# Module 1: Statistics

## 4. Mode

In this lesson you will learn:
- What the Mode is
- How you find the Mode

Prerequisites:
- Measurement levels

### Mode Lesson Summary

In statistics, the **mode** is a measure of center that identifies the most frequently occurring value in a dataset. It helps in understanding which data point is most common, making it valuable for decision-making, such as in sales predictions.

#### Importance of the Mode

For instance, an ice cream seller may want to know which flavor generates the most sales. The simplest approach is to identify the flavor that has been sold the most—this value is known as the **mode**.

#### Steps to Find the Mode

1. **Count** the frequency of each value in the dataset.
2. The value with the highest frequency is the **mode**.
3. If two or more values share the highest frequency, there are multiple modes.

#### Worked Examples

1. **Ice Cream Sales**:
   - Values: Lemon (2), Strawberry (5), Banana (3), Chocolate (1), Pistachio (1).
   - The mode is **Strawberry**, as it occurs most frequently.

2. **Paint Shop Colors**:
   - Dataset: **[green, blue, red, green, green, red, blue, black, white, yellow, green, yellow, green, green, green]**.
   - The mode is **green**, which appears most often.

3. **Running Match Finish Times**:
   - Dataset: **[1:00:05, 1:00:04, 0:53:53, 0:51:32, 1:00:09, 0:51:39, 1:00:07, 1:00:10, 1:00:42, 1:00:48]**.
   - No time appears more than once; thus, there is **no mode** for this continuous data.

#### Conclusion on Mode's Applicability

The mode is particularly useful for **categorical data** because it identifies the most common category. However, it becomes less meaningful for **continuous data**, where values often do not repeat, making mode calculation less practical. This highlights that the mode may not be a convenient measure of center for continuous datasets.
