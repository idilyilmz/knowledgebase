## 11. Partial derivatives

### Definition
A **partial derivative** of a function with several variables measures how the function changes with respect to one variable while keeping the other variables constant. This contrasts with the total derivative, where all variables can change.

### Notation
The partial derivative of a function \( f(x, y, \ldots) \) with respect to \( x \) is denoted as:
\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}
\]

### Examples
1. **For the function \( f(x, y, z) = 3x^2 - 2xy + yz \)**:
   - \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = 6x - 2y \)
   - \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = -2x + z \)
   - \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial z} = y \)

2. **For the function \( f(x, y) = 4x^2y^2 + xy^3 - 5 \)**:
   - \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = 8xy^2 + y^3 \)
   - \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = 8x^2y + 3xy^2 \)
