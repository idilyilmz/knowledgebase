# Module 3: Calculus

## 9. Find a Minimum or Maximum of a Function Through Differentation

In this lesson you will learn about:
- How to find the the maximum of a function through differentiation.

For this lesson you should be familiar with:
- What differentiation is.
- Differentiation of elementary functions.
- The sum rule.
- What maxima and minima are.

### Finding the Maximum of a Function

#### Example: Maximize $$ f(x) = -2x^2 + 4x $$

#### Understanding Maximum
- **Finding the maximum** refers to identifying the highest point of the function $$ f(x) $$ on its graph, where values of $$ y $$ are greater than neighboring $$ x $$ values.

#### Graphical Method
- The function reaches its maximum at the point **(1, 2)**, where $$ x = 1 $$ and $$ y = 2 $$.

#### Using Differentiation
- The derivative $$ f'(x) $$ indicates the rate of change:
  - **Positive derivative**: $$ y $$ value increases as $$ x $$ increases.
  - **Negative derivative**: $$ y $$ value decreases as $$ x $$ increases.
  - **Zero derivative**: Maximum point, where $$ y $$ neither increases nor decreases.

#### Finding the Derivative
- Differentiate $$ f(x) $$:
  $$
  f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}(-2x^2 + 4x) = -4x + 4
  $$

#### Setting the Derivative to Zero
- Solve for when the derivative equals zero:
  $$
  -4x + 4 = 0 \implies 4x = 4 \implies x = 1
  $$

#### Determine the Maximum
- At $$ x = 1 $$:
  $$
  f(1) = -2(1^2) + 4(1) = 2
  $$
- The maximum occurs at **(1, 2)**, consistent with the graphical representation.
