# Module 3: Calculus

## 3. The Product Rule - Introduction

In this lesson you will learn about:
- The product rule.

For this lesson you should be familiar with:
- The concept differentiation.
- How to differentiate elementary functions.

### Finding the Derivative of the Product of Two Functions

#### Example: Derivative of $$ x^3 \cdot \ln(x) $$

- **Functions**: The expression $$ x^3 \cdot \ln(x) $$ is the product of two functions:
  - $$ f(x) = x^3 $$
  - $$ g(x) = \ln(x) $$

#### Product Rule for Derivatives

- The derivative of the product of two functions is given by:
  $$
  \frac{d}{dx}(f(x) \cdot g(x)) = f'(x) \cdot g(x) + f(x) \cdot g'(x)
  $$

#### Standard Derivatives

- **Calculating derivatives**:
  - $$ f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}(x^3) = 3x^2 $$
  - $$ g'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}(\ln(x)) = \frac{1}{x} $$

#### Solution

- Using the product rule:
  $$
  \frac{d}{dx}(x^3 \cdot \ln(x)) = 3x^2 \cdot \ln(x) + x^3 \cdot \frac{1}{x} = x^2(3\ln(x) + 1)
  $$

Thus, the derivative of $$ x^3 \cdot \ln(x) $$ is **$$ x^2(3\ln(x) + 1) $$**.
