# Module 3: Calculus

## 2. The Sum Rule - Introduction

In this lesson you will learn about:
- The sum rule.

For this lesson you should be familiar with:
- The concept differentiation.
- How to differentiate elementary functions.

### Finding the Derivative of the Sum of Two Functions

#### Example: Derivative of $$ x^3 - \ln(x) $$
- **Functions**: The expression $$ x^3 - \ln(x) $$ is the sum of two functions:
  - $$ f(x) = x^3 $$
  - $$ g(x) = -\ln(x) $$

#### Sum Rule for Derivatives
- The derivative of the sum of two functions is given by:
  $$
  \frac{d}{dx}(f(x) + g(x)) = f'(x) + g'(x)
  $$

#### Standard Derivatives
- **Calculating derivatives**:
  - $$ f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}(x^3) = 3x^2 $$
  - $$ g'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}(-\ln(x)) = -\frac{1}{x} $$

#### Solution
- Using the sum rule:
  $$
  \frac{d}{dx}(x^3 - \ln(x)) = 3x^2 - \frac{1}{x}
  $$

Thus, the derivative of $$ x^3 - \ln(x) $$ is **$$ 3x^2 - \frac{1}{x} $$**.
