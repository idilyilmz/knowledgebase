# Module 3: Calculus

## 1. The Power Rule - Introduction

In this lesson you will learn about:
- How to differentiate polynomials using the Power rule.

For this lesson you should be familiar with:
- The concept differentiation.
- Polynomial functions.

### Summary of Deriving with the Power Rule

#### Differentiating an Elementary Function
- **Function to Differentiate**: $$ \frac{1}{x^2} $$ can be rewritten as $$ x^{-2} $$.
  
#### Standard Derivatives
Memorize the following derivatives of elementary functions:
| Function                   | Derivative                     |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------|
| $$ \sin(x) $$            | $$ \cos(x) $$                 |
| $$ \cos(x) $$            | $$ -\sin(x) $$                |
| $$ \tan(x) $$            | $$ \frac{1}{\cos^2(x)} $$    |
| $$ \ln(x) $$             | $$ \frac{1}{x} $$             |
| $$ e^x $$                | $$ e^x $$                     |
| $$ x^c $$                | $$ c x^{c-1} $$              |
| $$ c^x $$                | $$ c^x \ln(c) $$             |
| $$ c $$ (constant)       | $$ 0 $$                       |

#### Finding the Derivative:
Using the standard derivative for $$ x^c $$:
- For $$ 1/x^2 $$ (where $$ c = -2 $$):
  $$
  \frac{d}{dx} x^{-2} = -2 x^{-2-1} = -2 x^{-3}
  $$ 

Thus, the derivative of $$ \frac{1}{x^2} $$ is **$$-\frac{2}{x^3}$$**.
