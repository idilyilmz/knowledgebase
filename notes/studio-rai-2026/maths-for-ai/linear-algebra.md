# Module 2: Linear Algebra

## 1. Unit Vector

### Summary of Unit Vector Module

A **unit vector** is a vector with a length of **1** in a normed vector space. It is typically represented by a lowercase letter with a circumflex, such as **\( \hat{v} \)**. The term **normalized vector** is synonymous with unit vector.

#### Normalization
To find the **normalized vector** \( \hat{u} \) of a non-zero vector \( u \), you divide each component of \( u \) by its norm (or length), represented as \( ||u|| \):
- \( \hat{u} = \frac{u}{||u||} = \left(\frac{u_1}{||u||}, \frac{u_2}{||u||}, \ldots, \frac{u_n}{||u||}\right) \)

#### Applications
Unit vectors are crucial for:
- Representing directions, including normal directions.
- Forming the basis of a vector space, where any vector in that space can be expressed as a linear combination of unit vectors. 

Unit vectors aid in simplifying calculations and maintaining directional consistency in vector analysis.
