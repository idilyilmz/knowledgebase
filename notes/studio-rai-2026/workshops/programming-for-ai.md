# Summary of the Lesson: Python for AI

## Introduction
The lesson provides an overview of using **Python** for artificial intelligence (AI) development, highlighting its popularity and utility in data science.

## Homework and Setup
- **Developer Tools Setup**: Students need to prepare their programming environment, install **Python**, and choose an integrated development environment (IDE) such as:
  - Visual Studio Code
  - Anaconda
  - PyCharm
- **Python Version Recommendation**: Install an older version for compatibility, e.g., Python **3.11**, **3.12**, or **3.13**.
- **Jupyter Notebook Assignment**: Task involves creating a simple "Hello World" program using Jupyter Notebook.

## Python's Role in AI
- Created by **Guido van Rossum** in 1989, inspired by the comedy group **Monty Python**.
- **Advantages of Python**:
  - Easy to learn.
  - Popular in data science due to accessible libraries.
  - Simple library creation.

## Virtual Environments and Packages
- Students must create a virtual environment named **‘ds’** and install the **‘pandas’** package.
- Guidance is provided through a tutorial on managing Python packages and virtual environments.
- **Bonus Assignment**: Explore the **uv** package management tool, which is fast and efficient.

## AI-Assisted Programming
- Tips include prompt considerations for AI coding to improve code quality. 
- Students are encouraged to collaborate with AI tools, checking for alignment and understanding responses.

## Hugging Face Integration
- Introduction to **Hugging Face Transformers**, an open-source library containing various AI models.
- Assignments involve using **ResNet** for image classification and experimenting with a Google **Gemma model**.
- Activities include:
  1. Classifying images with a dataset of elephants.
  2. Prompting the Gemma model to answer questions.
