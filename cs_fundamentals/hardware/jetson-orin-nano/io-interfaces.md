# I/O Interfaces

## Camera
- CSI lanes for MIPI cameras
- Best for low-latency vision

## USB
- USB 3.x for cameras, storage, peripherals
- Shared bandwidth considerations

## Networking
- Ethernet for remote dev + streaming
- Useful for headless setup

## GPIO / Serial
- I2C, SPI, UART for sensors
- Not as beginner-friendly as Arduino

## Common Pitfalls
- USB camera bandwidth conflicts
- Power draw from peripherals
