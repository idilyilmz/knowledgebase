To keep your Jetson device running while you’re at school for your project, follow these tips:

## Power Management

### 1. **Ensure Constant Power Supply**

- **Use a Reliable Power Adapter**: Make sure that your Jetson is plugged into a reliable power source. Avoid using USB power from a computer, as it may not provide sufficient power.

### 2. **Prevent Sleep Mode**

- **Disable Sleep Mode**:
  - You can prevent your Jetson from entering sleep mode by adjusting the power settings.
  - In `NVIDIA Jetson`, you can use the terminal command:
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl mask sleep.target suspend.target hibernate.target hybrid-sleep.target
    ```

### 3. **Keep the Device Cool**

- **Ensure Good Ventilation**: Make sure your Jetson has proper ventilation to prevent overheating, especially during long-running tasks.
- **Use a Fan if Necessary**: If possible, provide additional cooling with a small fan directed at the Jetson.

## Remote Access Setup

### 4. **Set Up Remote Access**

- **SSH Access**: Ensure that SSH is running so that you can connect to your Jetson remotely while you’re away.
  - Start SSH server:
    ```bash
    sudo service ssh start
    ```
  - You can access it from another device using the command:
    ```bash
    ssh username@jetson_ip_address
    ```

### 5. **Use VNC for GUI Access**

- If you need graphical access:
  - Install a VNC server on your Jetson, which allows you to remotely access the desktop environment.

### 6. **Running Long Processes**

- **Use `screen` or `tmux`**:
  - These tools allow you to run terminal applications and keep them running even when you disconnect.
  - To install:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install screen
    ```
  - Start a new session:
    ```bash
    screen
    ```
  - You can detach from the session by pressing **Ctrl + A**, then **D**. Reattach later using `screen -r`.

## Additional Considerations

- **Test Everything Before Leaving**: Run a few tests to ensure all processes work correctly and can continue running without your intervention.
- **Make Backups**: Save your work frequently to prevent data loss.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your Jetson device remains operational while you’re at school, allowing you to work on your project effectively from a distance. If you have further questions or need clarification, feel free to ask!
